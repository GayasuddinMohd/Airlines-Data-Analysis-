# Airlines Data Analysis Project

## Business Problem

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. We have been providing high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years, and our primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers. However, we are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure, and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle this challenge, they are looking to conduct an analysis of their database to find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.

## Main Challenges
1. Stricter environmental regulations: The demand on the airlines industry to reduce its carbon footprint is growing, resulting in more stringent environmental laws that increase operating costs and restrict expansion potential.
2. Higher flight taxes: To address environmental issues and generate revenue, governments worldwide are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft, raising the cost of flying and decreasing demand.
3. Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs: The shortage of trained personnel in aviation has driven up labor costs and increased turnover rates.
